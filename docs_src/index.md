# BBMOD
Welcome to the official documentation for the latest version of BBMOD!

BBMOD is a 3D model and animation format specially crafted for GameMaker Studio 2.
It is accompanied by a conversion tool written in C++, as well as GML library that
allows you to load, animate and render BBMOD files without any hassle. The conversion
tool utilizes Assimp to load third-party model formats, so any model that Assimp can
load can be loaded into GMS2 using BBMOD. A few examples of such model formats are
`OBJ`, `COLLADA` or the industry standard `FBX`.
