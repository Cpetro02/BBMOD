# Loading models
Once you have your models and animations converted, you can put the `bbmod` and
`bbanim` files into your `Included Files` folder inside your GameMaker project.

Use struct [BBMOD_Model](./BBMOD_Model.html) to load a model:

```gml
modSword = new BBMOD_Model("Data/Sword.bbmod");
```
