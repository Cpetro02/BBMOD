# Installation
The BBMOD GML library can be installed using
[Catalyst](https://github.com/GameMakerHub/Catalyst), the open-source package
manager for GameMaker Studio 2. The installation process is fairly simple, using
just a few commands.

* First you initialize Catalyst in your project (if you haven't already):

```cmd
catalyst init
```

* Then you add BBMOD into your project's requirements:

```cmd
catalyst require blueburn-cz/bbmod 
```

* And then you install the required packages:

```cmd
catalyst install
```

All of these are of course run from your project's directory.
