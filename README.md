# About
BBMOD is a 3D model and animation format specially crafted for GameMaker Studio 2. It is accompanied by a conversion tool (BBMOD CLI), as well as GML library that allows you to load, animate and render BBMOD files without any hassle.

BBMOD CLI utilizes [Assimp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp) to load third-party model formats, so any model that Assimp can load can be converted to BBMOD. A few examples of such model formats are `OBJ`, `COLLADA` or the industry standard `FBX`.

BBMOD also comes with PBR shaders, fully supporting metallic workflow. This makes it compatible with assets that you would use in professional 3D game engines.
